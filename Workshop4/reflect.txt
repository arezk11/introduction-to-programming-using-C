1)
I made my code easy to read and maintain by using meaningful names for my 
variables and descriptive function names.
I also alined the code by spaceing my code in the loop and selection logic
to clearly see the different levels of nesting.

2)
If nested were not possible for this workshop it would be very hard to complete it
because, nesting allows me to create complex functions and statements that check for
multiple conditions and also it helps make the code more readable and easy to maintain.  

3)
Using a series of 'if' optional path constructs is inefficient for this scenario
because it requires me to check the same conditions multiple times.
But with the 'if else' alternative path logic, I can define a series of conditions 
that will be checked only once and then the next conditions will be done.
