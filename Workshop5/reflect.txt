1)

 A)to avoid errors because hard coding the values can be difficult to maintain and understand, also
 can cause errors to occur if the values are mistyped. macros make this erorrs less to happen
 because the value only needs to be entered once and then referenced through the code till the end. 

 B)to be easy to read and understand because i used meaningful names for the variables so anybody
   who reads the code can understand what each line doing and this could also help me if i returned to 
   this code after years i could still remember what does this code do and understand each line.

 c)easy to change in the future because if i wanted to update the code to 2023 instead of 2022 i 
   could easily do it by updating the macro MAX_YEAR to 2023 and delete 2022.  
2)
  by separating the two i can isolate errors and make it easier to modify or maintain the code in the
  future and also the validation process is only concerned with making sure that the user input is within 
  the intended range this is because changes made to one part of the code are less likely to affect other parts
  and it may be easier to update the values when seperating them.
