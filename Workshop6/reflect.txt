1)
there are three loops we have learned so far in c language 
for ,while ,do-while 
for me i am more comfortable with both while and do-while because they are somehow the same
plus they arent complicated compared to the for loop ,because the for loop should be used when 
I already know how many times will it iterateat.but the while loop keeps looping until the condition is met,
also the do-while loop is somehow similar to the while loop but it run the code before checking the the condition 
for this workshop I used for when dealing with arrays because the 'for loop' is used to iterate over the elements 
of the array and also it's easy to read and easy to fix its errors.  

2) 
while dealing with the semantic errors usually the VS does not mention them I find them my self when checking the 
output because I might coded the wrong variable for scanf or even the printf. but with the syntactic errors ,I usually 
forget to put a semicolon after the line and sometimes I misspeled a variable or a function but the VS tells me that 
I have an error in line 28 for example.

3)
I will first open the two files check them with my eyes and then identify the character that does not match
the output and look for the formating and the spaceing as well,then change it to the required output.
in this case I think the problem is with the printf statment it should be printf("Enter your Monthly NET income : $0"); 
and this could easily be changed by writtening the correct number after the dollar sign.
