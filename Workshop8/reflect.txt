1)
it makes the function more flexibly because if i am going to use the returned value in 
many places in the code its better to use the return value,and if i want to change the 
value of the argument its better to pass it as an argument 
but its hard to keep track of the data if the function has more than one way to return 
the value

2)
// 13. calculate: cost per calorie
double calculateCostPerCal(const double* price, const double* totCal, double* costPerServ);
the calculateCostPerCal and calculateCostPerServing are coupled and to improve this we 
can create another function that total numbers of servings so these functions can call it 

3)
the displayCatfoodData can be improved by using a pointer to CatFoodInfo structure instead of passing 
the entire structure because it saves more memory
